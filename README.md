# Type Mismatch in Function Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatch in function arguments.

The `add` function expects two numbers but receives a string as the second argument, causing a type error.

The solution shows how to fix the issue by correctly typing the arguments or using type guards.
